          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p> 
            The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a contagious disease known as Coronavirus disease.
            The COVID-19 virus gets mediated predominantly through droplets of saliva and mucus of an ailing person.
            Elderly people and populations which suffer from prevalent health issues akin to diabetes, heart diseases,
            and chronic respiratory illness are more likely to develop grave illnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients might develop COVID-19 pneumonia as a result of being infected by the coronavirus for which the
            diagnosis using chest X-Ray is difficult and time-consuming, but at the same time,
            a chest x-ray is the most commonly available option that can even be used in underdeveloped and remote areas
            where there is a shortage of specialists.
            Therefore, the implementation of newfangled artificial intelligence along with X-ray imaging may help in the
            precise detection of this disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project, an Xception Model is used to classify image samples of chest X-Ray data
            of patients having
            COVID-19 pneumonia thereby detecting the existence of Coronavirus in the patient.

            Machine learning is the study of algorithms that systems can take advantage of to accomplish a certain task.
            The systems rely on patterns and differences in provided data to learn.
            Machine learning algorithms help to build a systematic model based on data known as training data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks come under Deep Learning, which is a subsection of ML. The working algorithms
            under Deep Learning compute the data in a way similar to the brain of a human,
            in an Artificial Neural Network, there are units called nodes, which are interconnected in tandem in a
            layer-wise fashion, in which each node performs a simple calculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            CNNs are great with computations which require computation of pixel-related data and are used for tasks
            involving detection and identification of objects.
            In case of a complex problem which has many attributes, we can add in some extra layers to the Neural
            Network which can result in enhanced performance of the Network.
          </p>
          <p>By increasing layers in the Network, the layers are able to learn the complex attributes better and more
            accurately.
            However, adding more layers means more computation power is required, but simply having more layers will not
            always result in increased results.
            If the Network gets too deep, it might result in the accuracy degraded performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where Xception comes into the picture.It helps us to solve this degradation in
            performance which occurs by adding additional layers by introducing the concept of skip connections also
            known as shortcuts
            in between layers which allow faster transfer between deep layers.
