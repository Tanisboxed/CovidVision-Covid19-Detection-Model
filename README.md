The Covid-19 Detection project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to analyze lung X-ray images for indicators of COVID-19 infection. By utilizing extensive datasets and advanced image recognition technology, this initiative aims to offer precise and swift diagnoses, enhancing early detection and containment efforts. The project’s goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and accelerate response times, crucial for managing the pandemic effectively.

Scenarios
- Hospital Overload: During peak COVID-19 periods, overwhelmed hospitals integrate the AI system to expedite X-ray analysis. This rapid processing aids medical staff in triage and treatment decisions, efficiently managing patient flow and improving care under high pressure.
- Rural Clinics: In rural regions with limited access to radiologists, the AI system assists in COVID-19 screening. Automated lung X-ray analysis ensures timely detection, enabling early isolation and treatment to prevent virus spread.
- Public Health Monitoring: Public health authorities use the AI system to track COVID-19 trends across regions. By analyzing X-ray data from various facilities, they identify hotspots and allocate resources effectively, implementing targeted interventions to control transmission.

Deep Learning Models
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Fundamental for image classification, CNNs detect features in X-rays, distinguishing between infected and non-infected lungs.
- VGG16: This model is known for its deep architecture and strong feature extraction capabilities, enhancing the accuracy of detecting COVID-19-related abnormalities.
- ResNet50: ResNet50’s residual learning framework allows for effective training of deeper networks, improving detection performance by managing vanishing gradient issues.
- Xception: Xception, with its depthwise separable convolutions, offers high efficiency and precision in image recognition, making it ideal for distinguishing subtle COVID-19 signs in X-rays.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a comprehensive collection of lung X-ray images, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating the deep learning models. The images are categorized into COVID-19 positive cases, normal images, lung opacity images, and viral pneumonia images, all in PNG format with a resolution of 299x299 pixels.
